# CA01-House-Price-Analysis
The following program performs exploratory data analysis on a house price dataset. The dataset consists of 81 features, including House style type, neighborhood, surface area, etc., and about 1460 rows, with the target feature being the home's price. The notebook is then split into 3 parts: Data Understanding, Pre-processing, and Post-processing. 

## Data Understanding
This part consists of exploring and visualizing the data, checking for any missing values and outliers, and checking if any features are univariate, bivariate, or multivariate.

## Pre-processing
This part addresses errors and problems in the data, including handling missing data, outliers, normalizing numerical values, and encoding categorical data.

## Post-processing
And for this part, it checks for collinearity within the features, checking whether a feature has a relationship with the other and then identifying which features to drop.
